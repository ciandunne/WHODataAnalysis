## Task 1
Task 1 was accessong the API and scraping the necessary data for the analysis. I had to decide what data was relevant and which countries to choose from here.

## Task 2
Task 2 involved cleaning the data to make it useable and making sure the data between the different countries were comparable to each other. Task 2 also involved the comparison between the different countries by creating summary statistics and a lot of graphs using the data collected. Finally I wrote the conclusions that I drew from this data.
